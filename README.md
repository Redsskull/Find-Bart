- __background image__

- The entire game has a background image of space with all features being layed on it. 

- __The footer__

- The footer is there just to be cute. features a fun fact about Bart the cat and an icon of a basketball. 

## Testing

 - tested the style and buttons function with css. found that the planet buttons do not function on mobile. adjust design with flexbox and mobile querys to adjust. Used wrap and different dimensions to the divs. 

 - Absolute footer position did not work with wrap. used margin auto instead. 

 - Discovered when adding a game score div and a button that not having flex display for the main itself causes position problems. added the style properties to fix it. 

 - While making functions for the game, disocvered the need for a global function for computer value storing. 

 - Found out storing a hyper link as a button in a div is a bad idea. the button became invisible. fixed by making the div the button.
