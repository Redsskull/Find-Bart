# Find-Bart

Find Bart is a fun game for love who love cats and space where the user must find the planet Bart is lost in. it has some syth music, interactive UI and can be played easily on any device anywhere. 

## Features

- __The game area__

- The 3 panets, some text about the game and a score keeper.

- __background image__

- The entire game has a background image of space with all features being layed on it. 

- __The footer__

- The footer is there just to be cute. features a fun fact about Bart the cat and an icon of a basketball. 

## Testing

 - tested the style and buttons function with css. found that the planet buttons do not function on mobile. adjust design with flexbox and mobile querys to adjust. Used wrap and different dimensions to the divs. 

 - Absolute footer position did not work with wrap. used margin auto instead. 

 - Discovered when adding a game score div and a button that not having flex display for the main itself causes position problems. added the style properties to fix it.
